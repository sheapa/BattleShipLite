# BattleShipLite

# Objective:

Build a small, two-player console game rooted
in the boardgame game Battleship from Mattel.
There will be a 25-spot grid (a1-e5). Each player
Will place five pegs on the board to represent their
Five ships. Players will then take turns firing on their
Opponent’s ships. The first person to sink all 5
 Opponent’s Battleships wins.
